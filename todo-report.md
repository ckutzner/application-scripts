#to do for report
* template remains unchanged
## report.py
* output file (= report.tex) should get date timestamp in the filename
* **IMPORTANT** split output into several files if output is longer than 1 page
* for this: generate longer test file with test data
* find out how many lines make an output \> one page
## report-template.tex
* modify so that it references correct output file OR generate report wrapper - referencing correct \*report\*.tex file - from template via report.py
* DONE Remove real application data too!
