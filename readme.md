# Bewerb-O-Mat: A bash toolset for job applications
Just some bash and possibly later on Python scripts that help me apply for jobs faster and better by doing the tedious no-brainer work for me.

My application process relies heavily on LaTeX and the bash. Further utilities used are aspell for spell checking and thunderbird for sending mail.
This toolset also incorporates git operations at the crucial points. Comment them if you use a different VCS or want to control the git process manually.

This toolset is developed and tested under Ubuntu 12.04. Tests with other Linux/Unix-based systems are appreciated. Ports to other OS are welcome, too.

You will find a sample project in the folder sample-data. Use this if you don't want to test the utilites on "live" data.
